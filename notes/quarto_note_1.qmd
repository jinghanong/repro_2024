```{r}
#| label: load-packages

library(tidyverse)

```

## Formatting

**BOLD** two stars on each side, ~~strikethrough~~ two wavy strides on each side etc etc.

Go to Help -\> "markdown quick reference"

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

-   one

-   two

-   three

## Starting Fresh

(top right green button) +c or shortcut: ctrl+alt+I

### Loading data

"label:setup" will always run first "include: false" will not show this codechunk and any of its output/warnings but will still runs it.

```{r}
#| label: setup 
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

After loading the data, lets make a plot: "warning: false" hides all warnings. "code-fold: true" will allow the code to be folded into a section that could be seen if clicked on it

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true
#| label: fig-box
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot of penguin body mass (in grams) by sex"
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = sex, y = body_mass_g))+
  geom_boxplot()
```

As you can see in @fig-box, males are larger than females. You can also see this in @tbl-sample "\@ something" to cross reference.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-sample
#| tbl-cap: "Sample sizes of penguins by sex and island"
kable(table(penguins$sex, penguins$island, useNA = "always"))
```

### Citations

In [@Haidr2023], the authors discuss nothing related to this markdown. search "\\citation"

### Texting different symbols

*italics* \*italics\*

$a+b=\gamma$

equation block \$\$

$$ 

\frac{a}{b} = \sum\_{k=1}\^{\inf}(q+\beta) 
$$

{#eq-fake}
as you can see from @eq-fake, we dont know what he is doing with this equation, but thats how you name an equation and reference it :)
